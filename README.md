### What ?

We made a Book Renting website this week, we worked and made a database and connected it to the website, and the user can , search, add and remove entries from the database.

### Routes
Main Home page, everything can be done on the main website,
users can add entries with a popup, press a button either search or emove entries from the website
### How to use locally?

1. git clone this repo.
2. git install, if something was missing, please install manually to your machine, nyc, tape, tape-spec, supertest, nodemon.
3. for nyc tests, nyc npm test.
4. to deploy the server, we made an easy script for you, just type in your terminal 'npm run connect', and it will be deployed with nodemon, if you with to deploy without nodemon, just type in 'run start'.


### Main goals

- [x] Simple web app with a node server and a database
- [ ] Your database comes with a schema, which should be documented in your readme (along with any other architectural decisions)
- [x] Database hosted on Heroku, or locally
- [x] Build script for your database
- [x] Security concerns appropriately considered (you must protect against script injections!)
- [x] Content dynamic, but DOM manipulation kept to a minimum
- [] Mobile-first design
- [x] Clear user journey (even if you take one of our suggested ideas, document the user journey in your readme)
- [] test your server routes with supertest
- [ ] test your pure functions both server and client side
- [x] set up a test database so that you can test your database queries
- [] simple authentication

### Stretch goals

- [ ] Rating books
- [ ] Books can simultaneously be reserved by multiple users but for different dates
